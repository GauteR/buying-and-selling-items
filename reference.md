# Reference: Pricing, descriptions, flaws, marketplaces

Use this document when you need details on how to research prices, write honest descriptions, spot flaws, or tailor output to a marketplace. All output stays in chat; the agent never posts or writes to file.

## Pricing

- Use web search and comparable listings to estimate what similar items sell for. Prefer recent listings and the same or similar marketplaces when the user has specified one.
- Prices vary by location, condition, completeness (e.g. with/without box, accessories), and time. State briefly that figures are indicative and suggest the user check current listings.
- When giving a price range, mention condition (e.g. "used, good condition") and any factors that push the price up or down (brand, model, damage, rarity).

## Description

- **Honesty**: Describe the item accurately. Do not hide damage, wear, or missing parts; suggest how to phrase them clearly in a listing.
- **Keywords**: Include terms buyers typically search for (brand, model, category, key features). Keep the title concise; use the description for detail.
- **Condition**: State condition clearly (e.g. like new, good, fair, for parts). If describing from images, say what is visible (e.g. "minor wear on corners").
- **Measurements**: When relevant (e.g. furniture, clothing), suggest including dimensions or sizes if the user can provide them.
- Descriptions can be generated from images the user shares; combine what is visible with any text the user provides.

## Flaws and defects

- **What to look for**: Visible damage (scratches, dents, cracks), wear (fading, fraying), missing parts (accessories, manuals, original packaging), and signs of fakes or replicas where applicable (e.g. branding, serials, quality).
- **How to phrase in a listing**: Be factual and neutral. For example: "Small scratch on front; see photos." or "Sold as seen; no returns." Suggest the user mention flaws in the description so buyers are not surprised; this can reduce disputes and returns.
- Note how flaws affect the recommended price (e.g. "price reduced to reflect wear").

## Marketplaces

Generic tips – no APIs or automated listing creation. The agent only suggests text; the user publishes.

- **Finn** (Norway): Often Norwegian language; local currency (NOK). Popular for general second-hand; categories and location matter.
- **eBay**: Often international; multiple currencies. Buyers may expect detailed descriptions and photos; returns and seller ratings are important.
- **Facebook Marketplace**: Often local; language and currency follow the region. Quick, informal listings are common; still recommend clear condition and price.
- **Blocket** (Sweden): Swedish; SEK. Similar use cases to Finn.
- **Others** (e.g. DBA, Tori, national equivalents): Adapt language and currency to the platform; keep descriptions honest and clear.

When the user names a marketplace, tailor the suggested listing (tone, length, required fields if you know them) to that platform. If the platform is unclear, ask the user before finalising the listing.
